# polldaddy-rs

Yet another polldaddy quiz bot (in rust). `polldaddy` is the main library, while `polldaddy-spam` is an example binary. It is based on the alpha version of `reqwest`, using `tokio` 0.2.x and `hyper` 0.13.x.  

### Installing

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
polldaddy = { git = "https://github.com/adumbidiot/polldaddy-rs", rev = "56affa89bb9953d840de489763f7fef28092e6a3" }
```

## Getting Started
WIP. Look at `polldaddy-spam` for example usage.

## Testing
There are no tests other than `polldaddy-spam`. You can help by writing some.

## Contributing
I have almost no standards so anything you contribute will be an improvement. Just open an issue or pull request.
